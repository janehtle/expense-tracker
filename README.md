# Expense Tracker Challenge with React Native

**Task**: Create an application enabling users to log daily expenses with categorization options (e.g., food, transport). The project will focus on state management, form handling, and local storage for expense tracking. Optional: Implement a feature that allows users to visualize their spending through a simple chart (e.g., pie chart, bar chart) leveraging charting libraries like React Native Chart Kit.
